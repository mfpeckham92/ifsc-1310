<h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
 	<p>Web accessibility is about designing websites to provide an ergonomically efficient and user-friendly experience. It focuses on creating interfaces that are easy to navigate, understand, and interact with, promoting a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It involves optimizing the design and functionality of a website to enhance usability, regardless of how experienced or "tech savvy" the presumed user is.  The website has to be just as useable for a neophyte as for an experienced user.  If a user is unable to effectively access and pilot themselves through your website, they can't get to say your product or the information you're trying to give out. So while pure functionality is important, having a smooth accessible and ergonomic design is also of utmost importance to any webdesign based project.</p>
  
 <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
	<p>Progressive Enhancement is a web development approach that prioritizes unviersal useability at its core. Unlike the traditional concept of graceful degradation, it centers around building a solid content base in rich, semantic HTML. This content is then progressively layered with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. In essence, Progressive Enhancement is trying to make sure that all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities, receive a fundamental and accessible experience. This approach is attempting to do more than cater to top end browers and is more looking to consider overall accessibility, content availability, and mobile browser capabilities. It's a strategy that looks to the future of web development, accommodating various users and devices.></p>
    <p>This is an <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">additional article</a> I found, which is a more detailed dive into the various ideas behind progressive enhancement.</p>
    
<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
	<p>Looking back having finished the project I can certainly make note of a number of things that I learned.  All things considered it was an interesting project especially starting from a very baseline level.  My initial website was just a skeleton with no real structure or feature, just something I was going to hang the rest of the project around. However when I started to do the actual work on designing, it was interesting how much of that skeleton I had to go back and rewrite.</p>
    <p>I have a number of friends of mine who work in coding, but pretty much all of them are back end developers.  They were the people had look at things as I developed things iteration by iteration. So the perspective I got was far more a on a perspective of having functional and working code.  Though they also had very little to say in regards to css it was a interesting perspective getting their view on what was a front end development oriented project.  Almost all of the things they recommended for changes were entirely a measure of functionality in regards to some of the code and where to place things in CSS, and HTML.</p>
    <p>As for the semester there are plenty of things I could have done better.  I could have been more timely.  I could have paid closer attention.  I could have taken better note of what exactly the Friday labs were going to be.  Altogether being honest there was ample room for improvement on my part. I still think by and large I understood the general concepts of the course.  I've got a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and some of the more academic concepts about eurgonomic and accessibility in webdesign.  Overall I think I got what was needed out of the course.</p>
