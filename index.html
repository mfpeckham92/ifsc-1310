  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
 	<p>Web accessibility is about designing websites to provide an ergonomically efficient and user-friendly experience. It focuses on creating interfaces that are easy to navigate, understand, and interact with, promoting a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It involves optimizing the design and functionality of a website to enhance usability, regardless of how experienced or "tech savvy" the presumed user is.  The website has to be just as useable for a neophyte as for an experienced user.  If a user is unable to effectively access and pilot themselves through your website, they can't get to say your product or the information you're trying to give out. So while pure functionality is important, having a smooth accessible and ergonomic design is also of utmost importance to any webdesign based project.</p>
  
 <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
	<p>Progressive Enhancement is a web development approach that prioritizes unviersal useability at its core. Unlike the traditional concept of graceful degradation, it centers around building a solid content base in rich, semantic HTML. This content is then progressively layered with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. In essence, Progressive Enhancement is trying to make sure that all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities, receive a fundamental and accessible experience. This approach is attempting to do more than cater to top end browers and is more looking to consider overall accessibility, content availability, and mobile browser capabilities. It's a strategy that looks to the future of web development, accommodating various users and devices.></p>
