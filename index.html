  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  <p>Web accessibility is about designing websites to provide an ergonomically efficient and user-friendly experience. It focuses on creating interfaces that are easy to navigate, understand, and interact with, promoting a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It involves optimizing the design and functionality of a website to enhance usability, regardless of how experienced or "tech savvy" the presumed user is.  The website has to be just as useable for a neophyte as for an experienced user.  If a user is unable to effectively access and pilot themselves through your website, they can't get to say your product or the information you're trying to give out. So while pure functionality is important, having a smooth accessible and ergonomic design is also of utmost importance to any webdesign based project.  </p>
